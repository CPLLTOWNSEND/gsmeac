# GSMEAC app

##Intent
This is an application to be used to write and recite a set of orders following the GSMEAC format on a mobile device. 
It is intended to be used on a hand-held device rather than on a PC. It is a web app rather than a website page.

If you would like to contribute to the code, please feel free to fork a copy and submit a pull request.

##Instructions
The easiest way to use this on any platform is via a common browser. On a mobile device, navigate to the webpage for the app and then fill each text box according to the guidelines in the placeholder text.

The app can be saved to the home screen of your device by following the instructions for saving any web pages to the home screen. It can then be accessed via the icon, just like any other app.

At the moment, GSMEAC requires an internet connection to load the page but can be used offline once loaded. In this situation, do not refresh the page.
