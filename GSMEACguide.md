GSMEAC APP USER GUIDE
=====================

Introduction
------------
This is a web-based app that can be used to write and deliver a set of orders in GSMEAC format using a mobile device.

How to use the app
------------------

### Installing
Since this is a web-based app, there is no need to install it on a device as it runs from the CF web server. 

To use as a smartphone app: 
*   navigate to cadetforces.org.nz/gsmeac
*   follow your device's instructions for saving a website to your home screen.

	This should put an icon on your home screen that is a shortcut to the above address.

*   Use the app by selecting the icon you have just made.

### Writing orders
On most devices there are a couple options for entering text into the text boxes.
*  Tap or click into the box you wish to populate and the on-screen keyboard should appear as usual.
*  If your device has the ability to use speech dictation, follow the device's instructions to use that function.

Once you have completed your set of orders, click on the _Submit_ button at the bottom of the form to display the text as a script to read from.

### Saving, opening and editing
The GSMEAC app has some rudimentary save functions so that in some circumstances the user can preserve a set of orders to return to at a later date.

Because of the simplicity of the app's construction, there are some limitations to these functions compared to more complex applications we are used to:
*  Saved orders are stored in the browser itself, so can not be retireved from anywhere other then the browser they were saved on.
*  In order to "save as" or save a copy of a set of orders, simply save them with a different name.
*  Saving orders with the same name as a previously saved item will overwrite that item.

#### To save a set of orders:
*  Once you have submitted the text and produced the on-screen script, select the save option at the bottom of the screen.
*  Enter a name to describe the set of orders. **Warning** If you save over another set of orders by mistakenly using the same name, there is no way to undo and the original orders will be lost.
*  A dialogue will show to tell you the save was successful.

#### To open saved orders:
*  From an empty form, select the open button at the top, OR
*  From the script screen, select the open button at the bottom. **Warning** Any unsaved work will be lost as soon as the open button is selected.
*  Select the drop-down menu and pick the orders you wish to display (you may need to select "Done" or similar to confirm this, depending on your device).
*  Select the open button to display the chosen orders.

#### To edit orders after they have been submitted:
*  From the script screen, scroll down and select the edit button.
*  You will be returned to the form screen where you can edit the text.
*  When you are finished editing click submit again.
*  If you wish to save these changes, follow the instructions for saving, above. To overwrite the existing saved orders, simply enter the same name as the orders you wish to overwrite. **Warning** If you save over another set of orders by mistake there is no way to undo and the original orders will be lost.

#### To delete saved orders
*  Select the open button from any screen (as described above).
*  Select the orders you wish to delete.
*  Select the delete button. **Warning** This action can not be undone.
*  You will be taken back to the blank form screen in order to complete the delete.

### Starting a new set of orders
If you wish to open a blank form in order to start a new GSMEAC, simply use the browser's refresh function. **Warning** Any unsaved work will be lost.

### Changing the text size
The plus and minus buttons at top right will increase or decrease the size of the text. This will not resize button labels.
